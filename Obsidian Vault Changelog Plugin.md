An [[Obsidian Plugins|Obsidian Plugin]] for automatically generating a list of recently modified or created notes in a vault. 

I'm using [[Nicole van der Hoeven]]'s [variant](https://github.com/nicolevanderhoeven/obsidian-vault-changelog) of the plugin, which includes the ability to exclude specific folders from the change log.
