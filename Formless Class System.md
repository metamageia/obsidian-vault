Exploring the idea of a formless, [[Contractive and Expansive Worlds|expansive]] [[Class Systems]] , somewhat inspired by my experiments with [[Formless Magic Systems]]. The idea that characters are defined by [[Adding Gameplay Verbs and Goals]] though the acquisition of skills and items. A character would essentially be mechanically defined by a number of [[Traits (Design Pattern)|traits]] which combine to describe a specific action (such as heal, sneak, cast, fire, stab, etc).

The idea needs more development and exploration, possibly as a [[MOSAIC Strict]] module. It is somewhat similar to the [[Risus RPG]] approach to clichÃ©s.
