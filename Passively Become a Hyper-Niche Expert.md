One of the most effective way to [[Find Your Niche]] is to simply allow yourself to pursue any and all of your interests as they arise and organize what you learn in a trusted knowledge management system that easily facilitates linking ideas together (like [[Obsidian]]). The process of creating novel connections between your own special interests starts to surface new areas of extremely specific overlap and collision previously unheard of.  By honing in on topics of extremely unique specialization, you start to become an expert of a domain that very few people (if any) have even been aware of before - this is where somebody has the opportunity to carve out their own [[Hyper Niche]].  

This process can be significantly expedited by [[Learning in Public]]. Sharing what you're learning and allowing people to share their insights can significantly increase the rate at which you're exposed to new ideas, as well as illuminate potential blind spots in your knowledge. This feedback can often feel [[Make it Satisfying | incredibly rewarding]], and the [[Building Habits through Peer Pressure | positive peer pressure]] that comes along with that feed back goes a long way to sustaining motivation. 

A great side effect of learning and [[Working in Public]] (whether it's publishing notes, essays, articles, etc.) is that it also gradually generates a visible body of work that helps to passively market yourself as a specialist in your areas of interest and potentially establish yourself as an expert authority in your hyper-niche domain.

>"Putting all the worlds essays into one location has possibly been **the best “content” decision I’ve ever made.** I accidentally had written a book."
