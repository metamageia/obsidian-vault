A term is a word used to communicate knowledge unambiguously. Communication cannot occur unless two people are using the same words with the same meanings. Without clear terms, transmission of knowledge cannot occur. 

### Understanding Technical Vocabulary
Every field of understanding has its own technical vocabulary. It can be identified positively through familiarity with a field, or negatively through unfamiliarity.

Some common words are, confusingly, used technically. In any case, to reach understanding, one must rely on the context of surrounding words that are understood.
