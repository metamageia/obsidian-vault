[[Creativity Through Context Replacement]] is the most effective tool for generating new ideas, and one of the best methods for doing so is the Mashup. At its core, a Mashup is a novel collision of two ideas from different contexts into a new shared context. Many popular creative innovations throughout history have been the result of taking two familiar but disparate ideas and combining them in a unique way. 

### Game Design Mashups
An example of this in [[Game Design]] is through [[Atomizing and Abstracting Game Mechanics]] of two or more games and recombining them into novel formulations. Once you successfully reduce a system down to its [[Game Design Patterns|component design patterns]], swapping out similar patterns is both trivial and extremely fruitful. 

An example [[Raph Koster]] presents is not just experimenting with mashing up games with a shared underlying [[Topology]], but to also [[Change the Topology of a Game]] by mashing it up with seemingly unrelated games with different underling topologies.
