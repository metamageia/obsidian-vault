Working in an analog form forces one to reduce rules constructs down to their most abstract patterns. [[Raph Koster]] jokes that all video games are still "turn based" played at 60 turns a second, and with enough experimentation can be efficiently atomized and playtested using physical pieces. It is also an incredible exercise in [[Creativity Through Context Replacement]] as well as [[Forcing Creative Constraints]], as mixing and mashing pieces and patterns you normally wouldn't see next to one another can spark ideas one might not stumble across otherwise.
