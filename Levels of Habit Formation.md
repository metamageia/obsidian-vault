Habits are formed and reinforced at three different levels:
- Outcomes: The simplest to change, but don't have a lasting effect.
- Processes: Including deliberately designed systems, produce repeated outcomes that shift and reinforce the final level of identity.
- Identity: Formed by belief and reinforced by outcomes, identity automates processes and has the biggest impact on habitual behavior.
