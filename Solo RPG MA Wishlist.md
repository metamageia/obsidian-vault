- ~~makes me feel anything can happen~~
	- Should be able to surprise the player and provide tools to accommodate that
- ~~creates an interesting universe, not just character~~
	- Worldbuilding tools
- ~~offers oracles but doesn't drown me in them~~
	- Enough oracles to answer questions but not too many
- flow charts, cheat sheets + diagrams
	- Graphics that ground you in the gameloop when lost
-  trusts to make it work but doesn't make me do their job
	- strikes a balance between procedure and breathing room
- builds me a house but doesn't decorate it
	- Gives the contours of a setting but doesn't flood it
- theoretically can play forever
-  very wide or very narrow
	- either very specific or has an open play space
-  gives me examples of play
	- Gives enough examples to make it clear how niche mechanics work 
- gives me milestones to look forward to and a system to make my own
	- clear long term goals 
- shows me how to document my journey
	- Reifies milestones into an output and preserves progress
- gives me a reason to choose the game over real life
	- Has a clear hook and creates a desire to be in the world 
- save space and chuck safety tools
