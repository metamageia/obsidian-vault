The nodes are the moving points at which the [[Moon]]'s path intersects with the [[Ecliptic]]. These are the places where. [[Eclipses]] occur and therefor inherited a negative association early on in the tradition. However, later in antiquity the [[Ascending Node]] became associated with thing increasing (for better and worse), and the [[Descending Node]] with decreasing.
