When attempting to build a consistent reading habit for the first time it is incredibly useful to use the [[Laws of Habit Modification]] to your advantage.

One extremely effective way to [[Make it Obvious]] is to get a book stand to keep at the desk or table where you are most likely to read. Keeping the book upright and highly visible, especially if left open to the appropriate page, keeps it at the top of mind and also helps to [[Make it Easy]] to sit down and read a couple pages. 

This can be further enhanced with addition of [[Habit Score Cards]], which I've had massive success with. Instead of a conventional bookmark, consider making a Score Card tracking the days you've stuck to the habit. Marking a successful day on the Score Card is an easy way to [[Make it Satisfying]] to read even a really challenging or intimidating text, and the desire to see the score go up and avoid breaking the chain goes a long way towards [[Make it Attractive]].
