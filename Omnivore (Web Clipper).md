A [[Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)]] "Read It Later" app for saving web pages and articles. 

I used it alongside the Obsidian [[Omnivore Plugin]] to take notes on articles until the official Omnivore server shut down. I could host my own instance, but in an effort to  remain server-less I've opted to use the new official [[Obsidian Web Clipper]] instead.
