- Set up a couple aliases in my Claude Code nix modules to make getting into the vault context from any terminal much faster, and with the appropriate settings and permissions 
	- Also made sure thinking was enabled on the automated reflection 
	- spent some time in the evening tinkering with instructions and identity, establishing a more personal and context appropriate agent persona 
- going to try and rework my task management a bit
- had some idle thoughts about agents as servitors on my way to get dinner, curious about how one can overlap hypersigils and servitors with ai agents in my vault
