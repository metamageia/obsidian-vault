	- Became a lot more familiar with [[Hugo]], DNS & custom domain setup 
- Interested in setting up a LinkTree like website too
	- Got hyper-fixated on it and ended up working on it till 1:50 am as well as setting up my subdomains

- Going to start learning [[Terraform]] 
	- Successfully ran my first couple Terraform tests, spinning up some [[AWS S3]] buckets, a Budget, and a [[AWS DynamoDB]]. 
	- Also integrated it into a GitOps workflow, automatically applying my Terraform configuration to AWS when pushing to GitHub
- Interested in the [[Breadcrumbs Obsidian Plugin]]
