- I set up the [[BRAT Obsidian Plugin]] so that I could install [[Nicole van der Hoeven]]'s [variant](https://github.com/nicolevanderhoeven/obsidian-vault-changelog) of the [[Obsidian Vault Changelog Plugin]]. 
	- Also set up a [[changelog]] for the vault.
- Recently set up [[ReaPack]] and [[SWS Extensions]] in [[Reaper]] so I could set up [[Reableton]] as part of my transition between DAWs.
	- I needed to install them directly into the reaper .config folder, with some guidance from [this discussion](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/reaper-with-reapack/41924) on the [[NixOS]] forums.
- Started reading [[The Phenomenology of Aesthetic Experience by Mikel Dufrenne|The Phenomenology of Aesthetic Experience]] by [[Mikel Dufrenne]]. Spent some time contemplating some of the translator's notes in the forward regarding Dufrenne's distinction between the Aesthetic Object and the Work of Art. 
	- Watched an interesting [video by John Logan](https://youtu.be/iaZe3AlrCnI?si=1c4ebFIF0O221r2W) on the topic.

- Exploring the possibility of contributing music & audio to [[Endless Sky]]. There's a [Discord thread](https://discord.com/channels/251118043411775489/989659299645100112/1366021664717930587) discussing some of the specifics of contributing.
- Switched to [[Fossify Calendar]] after my existing calendar app started giving me grief. 
- In a conversation with "Christopher of the Cross" on the Man Alone Discord server, I laid out a working definition of the term [[Agent]] as I make sense of it in my own metaphysical framework.
- Added my Obsidian vault to [Github](https://github.com/metamageia/Metamageia-Obsidian-Vault), considering options for static site generation such as [[Quartz]]
