- Got up early and did some prep for the trespasser session 
	- The session went really well, might convert my notes and the chroniclers notes into a wiki. 
	- Going to lean a little bit away from the Eldritch vibe towards more low Fantasy. 
	- I need to do another pass on some of the combat rules before next session, as that was the biggest time sink.
	- The dungeon I made came out to 4 1/2 hours, just a little longer than ideal. Internalizing rules and the reduced action economy should help with that a bit next time
