- I need to find a solution for why Syncthing isn't syncing my vault over the internet, only local wifi. It wasn't an issue when it was just keeping my vault updated on the device I was using, but now that I'm not the only one making modifications in my vault throughout the day keeping things synchronized remotely is more important. 
	- The issue has been resolved, and was stupid and entirely my fault. I had forgotten to enable syncing over mobile data on my phone. Thank God I don't have to switch to a different syncing solution
