- Got up nearly an hour early because I couldn't get back to sleep
- Binded two more Trespasser reference signatures
- Updated the commoner generator to include a name visibility toggle for folks who want blank sheets
- Spent some time refreshing myself on the 2.1 Trespasser rules in preparation for tomorrow's session
