- Got up and around a bit earlier than usual and had some free time before work, so I decided to do a quick experiment adding a compact statblock view toggle to overlord, so give the option of more print/space friendly statblocks. Was surprised that Claude Opus was basically able to one-shot the feature, with follow up prompts only needed to make minor visual adjustments. It's still crazy just how good "Claude Code" is at code, the title is well deserved.
	- Tidied up the update and pushed it, it's now live. People seem to like it, much more print friendly and space efficient. It's nice to have as a toggle so the classic view is still front and center.
- Very interested in self hosting n8n and building some useful plugins/affordances with Claude, for example a discord bot for quick remote conversations from within the context of the vault
	- Going to put this idea on the shelf for now. Think it's better to avoid building tools for tools sake before I need them.
