- Going to reestablish my old digital PKM and productivity workflows
- Website Changes
	- Considering redoing the theme for blog.gagelara.com and using the github style theme for a daily microblog from these daily notes, possibly at daily.gagelara.com.
	- Also fixed a DNS issue with links.gagelara.com that's been around for awhile unnoticed.
	- Going to redirect gagelara.com to a portfolio website at a later date
- Began working on composing my notes on [[Preflighting (Print)]] and general design / print terminology to collect and demonstrate understanding.
