- Today I switched the theme of [my blog](http://blog.gagelara.com) to a more conventional blog format and plan to use the github theme for my [daily blog](http://daily.gagelara.com) instead
- I also did a bit of work cleaning up what I hope to be the last of the bugs in the 2.1 version of the [commoner generator](https://metamageia.github.io/Peasant-Generator/) 
- The daily blog is set up, but I'll need to make some changes to auto convert the obsidian links into links to my vault website
