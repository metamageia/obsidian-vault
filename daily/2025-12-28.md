- Today I switched the theme of [my blog](blog.gagelara.com) to a more conventional blog format and plan to use the github theme for my [daily blog](https://metamageia.github.io/daily.gagelara/) instead
- I also did a bit of work cleaning up what I hope to be the last of the bugs in the 2.1 version of the [commoner generator](https://metamageia.github.io/Peasant-Generator/)
