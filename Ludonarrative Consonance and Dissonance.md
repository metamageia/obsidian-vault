A concept in [[Game Design]], the term Ludonarrative Dissonance was first coined by [[Clint Hocking]] to describe the experience of conflict between a game's narrative message and mechanical execution. By contrast, Ludonarrative Consonance is the inversion of this term as a way of conceptualizing an approach to game design in which a game's narrative and mechanical themes reinforce one another.
