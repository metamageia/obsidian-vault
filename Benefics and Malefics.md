Meaning "good makers" and "bad makers" respectively. [[Jupiter]] and [[Venus]] are of the former, [[Saturn]] and [[Mars]] of the latter. [[Mercury]] is common. In the sky, the benefics are bright white, while the malefics are darker, likely the original source of this distinction. They are affirm or deny the quality and intensity of different [[Planets]], either could be made good/bad based on [[Sect]]

The qualities of the [[Luminaries]] are a topic of debate. The [[Moon]] is generally considered benefic, while the [[Sun]] is either benefic or common (like Mercury) - possibly because of its positive illumination of aspected planets but malefic quality when a planet is [[Under the Beams]].
