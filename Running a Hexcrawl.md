## Introduction
A "hexcrawl" is a mechanic for abstracting long distance travel and exploration in TTRPGs. In the early days of Dungeons and Dragons, this system was derived from the board game ["Outdoor Survival" by Avalon Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outdoor_Survival)

> I'm very interested in exploring ways to convert or abstract boardgames into RPG mechanics, potentially as [[MOSAIC Strict]] modules


One of the most popular examples of a Hexcrawl is a campaign known as "The West Marches", [described in this blog post from Ars Ludi](https://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/78/grand-experiments-west-marches/), which essentially launched an entire new subgenre of TTRPG campaigns. 

## Resources

First, here is a long list of [Hexcrawl resources](https://arsphantasia.wordpress.com/2014/02/20/hexcrawl-resources/) from the blog Ars Phantasia to comb through.

Additionally:
- [Hex Generator](http://welshpiper.com/hex-based-campaign-design-part-1/) for creating blank hex grids. 
- [How to Hex crawl video with great info](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eC-h1haFSIA)
- [Wilderness Hexplore](https://dn720001.ca.archive.org/0/items/wilderness-hexplore-revised/Wilderness_Hexplore_revised_112913_us.pdf) is basically my hexcrawl bible
