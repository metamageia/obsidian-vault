Reading for the sake of deep understanding. To grasp a book and work at it until it becomes your own. The process of analytical reading require that you ask questions that you will answer for yourself as you come to better understand the text:
1. What is the book about as a whole?
2. What is said in detail, and how?
3. Is the book true, in whole or in part?
4. What is the significance of what is being said?

### Rules for Analytical Reading
