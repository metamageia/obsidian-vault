(Explain Dice Pool Mechanic)
## Intro Text
- The rusted steel of an aging railroad carves a path through the desolate wasteland. 
- A heavy blanket of eternal night suffocates the countryside. 
- Towering forests of glowing fungus dot the abyssal horizon. 

> The village of Mournwater lays rotting and empty, as most have since the collapse. You hear them before you see themâ€”a hiss of escaping steam mingled with the ragged gasps of starving wretches. 
## Pressure Pools
- Encounter a lone Dredge, footsteps on the roof, dense red mist drifts 
- The mist burns their lungs, Hulk slamming in adjacent building, pack of dredges enter
- Hulk ambushes players, train blasts through depot, character develops vampirism 

## Useful Pieces
- Biomechanical Vampires with flesh stretched taut over cogs and hissing pistons prowl the dark, equal parts monster and machine. 
	- Dredges are extremely frail, but hunt in packs. Will attempt to pin their prey to the ground to feed.
	- The Boiler Hulk is a towering abomination and can endure a lot of pain. Its claws are tipped with large syringes that feed the blood-filled boiler carried on its back. It periodically blankets the surrounding area with a superheated crimson steam from the tank's vents. 
- Crimson Steam drifts throughout the village, leaving the lingering stench of copper and rot.
	- Roll d4 to determine initial density pool, a thicker mist means the Boiler Hulk is nearby. 
	- A fresh cloud of steam burns the flesh, and inhaling any amount too frequently runs the risk of contracting vampirism. 
- Bioluminescent Fungus illuminates the village with a sickly blue-green light. 
	- Some mushrooms can be as bright as torches, and remain lit for an hour after being picked.
	- Some may provide improved night sight when consumed, but induce significant physical or mental exhaustion.
