## Challenge Rolls
Basic Challenge: When performing a task with a chance of failure, make a Basic challenge:

Roll a Challenge Die (1d6) vs 2d8
- If the Challenge die is higher than or equal both d8s: Success 
- If the Challenge die is higher than or equal to only one d8: Success, with a Drawback
- If the Challenge die is lower than both d8s: Failure, with a Drawback

When you Challenge a Stat, add that Stat to your Challenge Die.

When you use a Skill in your Psyche, roll 2d6 and take the higher number. 


## Inventory Rules
Your total inventory slots equals 5 + Might
Most items take up one slot. Items that could fit in a pocket can share a slot with any one item. Heavy armor takes up two slots. 

When you gain a Fatigue or Wound without an empty slot, immediately drop an item to make room for it. If you gain either while your inventory is completely full of Fatigue/Wounds, you die. 

Shields and worn Armor may occupy the same slot as a Fatigue or Wound. When adding a Wound to a shield/armor slot convert it to Fatigue.

You start with any one common weapon, a ration, a trinket, and a background item.

## Psyche Rules
Your total Psyche slots equal to 5 + Intellect.
Skills and Spells take up one slot. 

When you gain a Stress or Trauma without an empty slot, immediately  clear a skill or spell to make room for it. If you gain either while your Psyche is completely full of Stress/Trauma, you are broken and lose control of this character.
