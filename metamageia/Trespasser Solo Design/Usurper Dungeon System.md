- Dungeon Actions (3 Total)
	- Explore: 
		- Can only be used when moving into an unexplored room
		- Roll 2d20 vs 10+Tier to determine room archetype and danger, with 1d6 to determine the number of features, and 1d4 to determine the number of doors. One d20 should be on Trait table, the other on Form table.
			- If the 1d6 result is lower than the Hostility Tier, you encounter an enemy 
			- Note the value on the 1d6 for the number of features in the room
			- Tally the total sparks and shadows on the 2d20 roll for feature generation
		- Resolve combat if relevant
		- After the player(s) roll their intellect|perception check, roll 2d20 generation roll for each feature they investigate
			- Because trespassers are always looking for threats (pg 250), harmful features will always be investigated first.
			- One d20 will be on the Trait features list, the other will be on the Form d20 list
			- If you have both sparks and shadows, each feature you roll for will have both common loot and a risk of a shadow?. If it's just a spark, it's uncommon loot. If it's just a shadow, it's a trap. 
	- Search:
		- If player(s) investigated fewer features than total while exploring, this action can be taken to investigate the rest.
