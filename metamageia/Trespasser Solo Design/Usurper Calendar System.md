World Frame Sheet?
Four Overlord Clocks 
- Master Plan

Every in-game week, roll 2d10 on an Event Table (like Mythic’s Fate Chart or Ironsworn’s Oracles):

1-10: No major event (minor worldbuilding detail).
11-40: A faction takes action (introduces or progresses a faction’s goal).
41-65: A strange rumor spreads (hinting at something larger).
66-85: An Overlord’s influence is felt (a consequence happens, but no Overlord is revealed).
86-95: A new Overlord emerges (they were always there, but now they become a known force).
96-100: An Overlord makes a major move (immediately changes the world state)
