# The Theurgist
A calling for one who would bridge the chasm between mortal despair and divine mystery.

In a world steeped in cynicism and the dying echoes of forgotten gods, you have discovered that the sacred rites of old—whispered in hidden temples and etched in ancient hymns—still carry the power to stir souls. While others dismiss such archaic rituals as the ramblings of madmen, you have felt the unmistakable touch of the divine in moments of quiet revelation. It was not chance that set you on this path, but a profound summons from realms unseen—a beckoning to rekindle the dormant fires of transcendent truth. Embrace the call of the sacred, and let your voice be the beacon that summons the gods back to a world starved for wonder.

### Initial Skills

### Expert Fortitude
When you take up this calling, your hit points increase by an extra +5. This makes your hit point total at second level equal to 15 + 2 (MIGHT).

### Sacred Incantations 
The strength of your faith lends you the power to cast incantations. When you take up this calling, learn INTELLECT + 2 incantations. Whenever your INTELLECT increases at higher level, learn another. You learn them randomly from the sacred magic table

### Divine Virtues
Theurgists spend much of their time in sacred ritual to invoke the gods to induce their presence and embody their divine virtues. When you take up this calling, replace one of your alignment traits with a Virtue. You gain the Lasting State associated with your chosen Virtue with an intensity equal to its total affirmations +1.

As a camp activity, you may choose to invoke a different Divine Virtue. This replaces your existing Divine Virtue. Doing so does not reset its affirmation or denial progress. Replace the Lasting State associated with your previous Divine Virtue with the new one. You may not take a Divine Virtue when suffering a lasting effect that would be canceled by its associated State.
