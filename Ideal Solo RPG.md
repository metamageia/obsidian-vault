Accessible and Logical rules
Progressive disclosure 
Tools for getting into play quickly, generating prompts, etcPaths / Flow Charts / Algorithms in TTRPG Mechanics 

- Procedural play, with a clear flowchart gameplay loop, including a "session start" procedure, with more complex systems progressively disclosed as the campaign develops. 

---

Streamlined worldbuilding tools
Fresh and thematic Generators

- Procedures for generating a fresh twist on the core setting/genre, with plenty of tables for building out the surrounding world.

Social Mechanics
rules for playing other characters in the scene in a procedural way
Solo party and faction dynamics
solo games where you switch points of view often, rotating between characters 
Mechanics that force the character to do things the player might not want to do

- Clear, procedural rules for NPC behaviors beyond simple oracle tables. Universal party/faction sheet and moves/mechanics. Relationship mechanics & moves which trigger specific responses. 
- Player rotates between characters and makes checks based on their current POV, which initiates a procedural response. Can integrate with Psyche mechanics requiring characters to respond in ways the player might not expect.

Campaign sheets and tools
Downtime Mechanics

- Systems for tracking and managing progress & meta-progression beyond just the characters. Tools for reifying the game state for other procedures. 

---

Tactical combat that's light on crunch

- Identify what decisions are the most fun to make and allow randomness to introduce a gradient of effects, rather than a binary. Weapons and armor should have/be abilities just like spells are while still being lightweight.

Community games with a shared bulletin / world events for Solo players
Game with mechanics for integrating Solo and Group play, narrowing the gap 

- Procedures for switching frames between group and solo play. Solo systems and procedures for developing character without necessarily unbalancing adversarial systems like combat. 
- Shared worldbuilding systems / events that allow players to anchor their characters to a shared world. Real time seasonal effects? Calendar events? 
	- Would need to abstract real time from game time to avoid weird decoupling.

Mystery Mechanics 

- This needs some research and examination, as I've never really run mystery systems before. 

---

Oracles

- Enough oracles to run the world, but doesn't drown play in tables
