An idea I've been exploring is the overlap between [[Solo Journaling Games|Solo Journaling RPGs]] and [[Hypersigils]]. I've had a lot of deeply profound experiences using journaling games as a method of [[Journeying]], of exploring the [[Mundus Imaginalis|Imaginal]]. Some recent experiments in using the interactive nature of journaling games as a method of ritualized [[Active Imagination]] and resulting [[Synchronicity|Synchronicities]] has opened up the possibility for these games, and [[Table Top Role Playing Games (TTRPGs)|TTRPGs]] more generally, as an interface for [[Practical Enchantment]]. I'll be writing more about this subject as future experiments generate more insights.
