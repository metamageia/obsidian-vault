A specific systematization of the [[Skills (Design Pattern)]], use-based skill systems are a family of mechanics wherein skill progression is tied to practice and repetition over time. This type of system was first popularized by [[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]].

The main attraction of a use-based system is that it leads to a freeform approach to progression, where a character's development is determined by what they choose to use on a regular basis rather than arbitrary point investment. 

The issue with most use-based systems isn't actually repetition, however - it is the lack of a meaningful and engaging challenge. This is an example of [[The Goldilocks Rule]] in action. If you want a system or mechanic to be enjoyable for a player, it is important to [[Make it Satisfying]]. 

However, if a system is made repetitive but not engaging, players will still eventually force themselves to engage with the unenjoyable mechanic [[Building Habits through Peer Pressure|upon seeing other players getting better results than them]]. This will result in players reporting a grind-heavy and unpleasant experience. 

It is important to remember that skills, as well as other kinds of [[Traits (Design Pattern)|traits]], are meant to be *enablers* rather than the point of play. They should be designed as *verbs* to overcoming *obstacles* to reach a *goal*, not designs as goals in and of themselves.
