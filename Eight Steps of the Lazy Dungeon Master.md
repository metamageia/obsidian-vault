- Eight Steps of the Lazy DM
	- Review the Characters
		- Understanding the context and needs around each character helps to remind you what is worth focusing on from session to session. 
		- Even if you don't know the characters, you can review the players to consider what to bring to the table.
	- Create a Strong Start
		- Strong start is important to every session regardless of context. Players most clearly remember the beginning and end of a session. 
	- Outline Potential Scenes
		- The outlining of scenes is a catch-all for very general outcomes or specific events. These shouldn't be railroad-y, but rather simple bullets outlining potential causes and effects. 
	- Define Secrets and Clues
		- Defining roughly ten secrets and clues gives you plenty to work with each session. A single sentence each is enough 
		- If working from a big setting or adventure, pick out the most interesting stuff for your list
	- Develop Fantastic Locations
	- Outline Important NPC
	- Choose Relevant Enemies
	- Select Major Rewards
		- Allow players roll dice on treasure tables so they feel directly connected to what they get
