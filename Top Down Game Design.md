Also called "Theme First" or "Experience First" design, this methodology is concerned with identifying a specific feeling or aesthetic experience a designer wishes to capture and breaking it down into its key verbs and scenarios. From there the process becomes a matter of translating those verbs and scenarios into analogous [[Game Design Patterns]] and gradually [[Merging Gameplay Mechanics]] until you arrive at an appropriate rules construct. 

The risk with top down design is filling the game with incredibly generic mechanics by exclusively pulling patterns from games with a similar theme, effectively becoming a [[Koster's Taxonomy of Games|reskin of games the player has seen dozens of times before]].

[[Raph Koster]] gives the advise of trying to model an unusual event by telling a story that isn't often told or by adopting [[Changing Gameplay Metaphors|unique gameplay metaphors]].
