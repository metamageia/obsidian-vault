A [[Vector]] based (rather than [[Raster]] or [[Bitmap]] based) [[Font]] specification developed by Adobe for digital typesetting using the [[PostScript]] file format. One of its key features is that it solved the issues around font scaling by introducing [[Font Hinting]], which included additional mathematical information for preserving the critical features of each glyph in a given typeface.
