In [[Jay Springett]]'s model of [[Worlds]], all [[Techno-Social Systems]](including games)can be thought of as belonging to one of two categories. 

Contractive worlds are ones where the level of agency decreases as the world unfolds. Actions taken by users / players gradually reduces the possibility space of future moves as the world closes in and behavior is guided towards an end state. Examples of mechanically contractive game worlds are puzzles such sudoku or crosswords, which tend towards a state of completion with every action. 

Expansive worlds, by contrast, allow for the possibility space to open up as agency is expressed. Actions taken generally trend towards an increase in the quantity and/or variety of actions available in the future. An excellent example of mechanically expansive game worlds is [[Solo Journaling Games]], which are typically limited only by the creative whim of the individual player.
