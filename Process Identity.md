- A very rough idea I'm developing regarding a process-oriented phenomenology of identity
- As a process identity has two poles, the "mental" and "physical" - or the un-actualized and actualized. 
	- It is a constellation of aims towards an ideal, an eternal object, and a historicity of concresences 
- Identity is relationally composed based on preference and desire. The things we identify with are those phenomena which are most preferred in relation to their alternative
	- If preference is rooted in Desire as the good of the self, then identity is a negotiation between historicity and a yearning towards the good. 
- Might be developed into a sort of [[Process Phenomenology]]?
