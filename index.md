## The Metamageia Vault

Welcome! My name is Gage Lara aka Metamageia. 

What you're seeing here is a combination of my personal website and my working notes from my Obsidian notes vault. Many of the notes you'll find here are little more than rough and incomplete ideas and musings about what I'm interested in learning - all shared online as an exercise in learning in public. 

Checkout my blog over at [my blog](https://blog.gagelara.com). If you want to see some of these interests in action check out my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/metamageia)and connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gage-lara), my TTRPG creations on [Itch.io](https://metamageia.itch.io/), or check out some of my music on [Bandcamp](https://gagelara.bandcamp.com/). Check out [this page for more of my links](https://links.gagelara.com).

If you like any of the stuff I do, you can consider [buying me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/metamageia).

## How was this set up?

All of the notes here were written in [[Obsidian]], my [[Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)]] tool of choice. My notes are backed up in a [[Github]] repository and synced across multiple devices with [[Syncthing]]. Depending on when / where you're reading this note, my vault is hosted as a [[Static Site Generator|static site]] generated using [[Quartz]] and hosted via [[Github Pages]]. 

This page and many parts of this vault are heavily inspired by [[Nicole van der Hoeven]]'s website [Fork My Brain](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Fork+My+Brain), which is worth checking out.
