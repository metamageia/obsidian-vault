A concept I'm playing around with is randomly rolled class abilities like those found in [[MörkBorg]] but extending the concept further to a classes approach, though still includes character Roles. 

The character generator will include options for the character's [[Roles (Design Pattern)|role]] in combat, survival, and possibly social encounters. It should also include a [[Dungeons and Dragons 4th Edition|D&D 4e]] style "power source" which changes the way each role is expressed. 

This [[Game Design Patterns|design pattern]] lends itself to a three or four axis [[Design Matrix]] demarcating the [[Design Space]] for different character archetypes. If properly designed with multiple, flavorful options for each combination the class options should be incredibly diverse.
