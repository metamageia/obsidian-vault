We often think of games in their totality as singular objects; however, as explored in [[Koster's Taxonomy of Games]], the definition of a "Game" at its core is "a unique rules construct".

These individual games and their component mechanics can be further abstracted into [[Game Design Patterns]] that can be modified or interchanged.
