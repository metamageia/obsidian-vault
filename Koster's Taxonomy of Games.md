Game designer [[Raph Koster]] presents a hierarchical taxonomy for describing what games *actually are* (and, consequentially, what they are not). 
- A **Game** is a unique rules construct.
- A **Reskin** is a superficial change in presentation of an existing rules construct.
- A **Variant** is a minor mechanical deviation from an existing rules construct.
- A **Family** is a set of Variants.
- A **Genre** is a set of Reskins and their Variants. 

Almost every video game made today is actually a Variant rather than a unique game, in contrast to board games which are more often than not entirely new rules constructs.
