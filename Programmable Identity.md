Taking the idea of [[Programmable Attention]] even further, [[Spaced Repetition]] systems such as a [[Vision Deck]] can be used to prompt changes in [[Identity]] over time. In his book Atomic Habits, [[James Clear]] talks about how creating [[Make it Satisfying|satisfying systems]] produces repeat [[Levels of Habit Formation|outcomes that reinforce identity]]. By consistently resurfacing goals, values, relationships, projects, etc - one gradually *re-minds* and *re-internalizes* those parts of oneself. 

[[Andy  Matuschak]] writes in his note on [Spaced Repetition Systems as Catechism ](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zPtcwHaKGoLEZRzSoScYXha) that like Catechism, spaced repetition systems effect identity through repeat exposure. A highly effective path to the internalization and automation of desired outcomes would be the integrating of a new identity though these methods. For example, if one wanted to become a great writer then that identity can be efficiently adopted though the systematization of an [[Incremental Writing]] routine.
