Best Practices:
- [[Agile]] Project Management with To Do, In Progress, Code Review, and Done. Break projects down into Epics, Stories, and Themes. Use [[Scrum]] and [[Kanban]] 
- Shift Left with [[Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI&CD)|CI/CD]] by bringing testing into development early. 
- Build with the right tools. 
- Implement Automation in integration, testing, and deployment. 
- Monitor the Pipeline to ensure a broken build or failed test doesn't result in delays. 
- Implement Observability. The three pillars of Observability:
	- [[Logs]]: Time series data about system or application processes.
	- [[Traces]]: Tracking of logic flow within an application.
	- [[Metrics]]: Resource usage, connectivity, etc.
- Continuous Feedback. Communication of pipeline failures, test results, production failures, performance deficiencies, and bugs. 
- Culture. DevOps is a philosophy of collaboration and communication between roles and teams.
