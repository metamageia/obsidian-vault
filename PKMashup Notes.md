As part of a daily [[Incremental Writing]] and PKM routine I've been having great success with what I've started to call PKMashup Notes. The process is pretty simple: every day when I sit down to start working on my [[Writing Inbox]] I open two random notes from my [[Obsidian]] vault using the [[Smart Random Note Plugin]]. My task then is to brainstorm and create an entirely new note linking those two ideas.

What that note looks like is open to exploration. It could be a new idea or concept connecting two concepts I've written about previously, they can be new [[Game Ideas]], or a bit of fiction in the form of short/micro stories or a bit of poetry. 

How the note connects the two ideas is highly flexible and open to interpretation. Sometimes the new idea directly connects the two random notes in a very clear way, sometimes it's loosely inspired by a combination of specific sections or concepts in each note, and sometimes it can draw on entirely different notes linked by the random selections. What matters isn't the two specific notes, but the exercise of creating new connections that wouldn't otherwise be made.

Adding the following section to PKMashup notes helps to track them in the vault as they develop over time, as well as what two ideas originally launched the idea: 

> This note is a #pkmashup  of ------- and ------ . See [[PKMashup Notes]] to learn more.
