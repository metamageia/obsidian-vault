# @Spelldivers Changelog 11-15-25

It's been a while, here's a few extra changes I had previously decided on but didn't make it into the previous changelog.

- Broments now upgrade a spell die of your choice by one size (up to max of d12) until the end of the mission
- Revised spell glyph list with a few additional glyphs, now 12 in total, included a Chaos glyph that changes type each time you cast it
- Increased total player spell points from 3 to 4
- Redeploying a dead ally on your turn now costs 1 spell point but no actions, and they may immediately *either* act or move for free
- Put together a starting 1d10 Arcane Catastrophe list inspired by your suggestions, tuned for brevity and to better fit existing mechanics. This will be massively expanded over time.
