# Travel
The following procedures modify & extend exploration based travel.
1. When making a Wayfinding check, the party simultaneously rolls 1d10. If the result is equal or less to the HOSTILITY TIER, the party veer off their intended path, and their Wayfinding check determines how far they travel in the wrong direction. If they don't, the Wayfinding check doesn't matter.
	1. Regain Heading: On a success with a spark, the party regain their heading immediately and travel in the right direction without any lost time.
	2. Detour: On a success with no sparks, the party goes astray briefly, then regain their heading. They travel half the normal distance on their advance.
	3. Traveling in Circles: On a failure with no shadows, the party travels gets lost in their current hex and does not move this advance.
	4. Full Digression: On a failure with shadows, the party travels in the wrong direction, then regain their heading afterward. Roll a 1d6 (rerolling 6's) and count that many hex faces clockwise from their intended direction for the full distance of their advance.
2. Upon Entering a new unexplored, Hex roll 1d8 (Hostility) and 1d20 (Terrain) together, following the procedures below.
3. If moving into a tile you already know has a River or Road, follow the appropriate procedures under the Hex Features section.
4. When a player character uses the Explore camp action and succeeds on their check, follow the Hex Features procedure to check for and generate points of interest.
5. When a player character uses the Scout camp action and succeeds on their check, include the following among their choices (in addition to the other options included in the Scout action):
	1. Reveal an adjacent unexplored hex following the Hostility and Terrain procedures.
6. Using the advance action you may spend 4 points of movement per day.
	2. Leaving a hex as part of an Advance action costs a specific number of movement points depending on Terrain:

| **Terrain Type**                                               | **Movement Cost** |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Flat (Plains, Savannah, Steppe, Roads, Tundra, Desert)**     | 1 Point / Hex     |
| **Mixed (Forest, Rain Forest, Hills, Marsh, Thickets, Dunes)** | 2 Points / Hex    |
| **Difficult (Mountains, Swamp, Glacier, Caves, Jungle)**       | 3 Points / Hex    |
- At the end of an advance action, roll two d10s vs Hostility: one for an encounter, one for a POI. If the result of either is less than hostility, it occurs. On doubles of any value, both occur.
### Hostility Generation

When Advancing into an unexplored Hex, generate the hex's Hostility Tier by rolling a 1d8 and adding only the highest known Hostility Tier among adjacent hexes:

| 1d8 + Adjacent Hostility | Hex Hostility          |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| 2 – 5                    | Tier I - Bleak         |
| 6 - 7                    | Tier II - Sinister     |
| 8 – 9                    | Tier III - Frightening |
| 10 – 11                  | Tier IV - Harrowing    |
| 12 – 13                  | Tier V - Nightmarish   |

### Terrain
When Advancing into an unexplored Hex, generate the hex's Terrain type by rolling 1d20 on the chart appropriate to the current region. Select the result from the column associated with the terrain type you are entering the new hex from.

Whenever you roll a natural 1 on terrain, roll on a trait table. Newly generated tiles of the same terrain type adjacent to the hex inherit its Trait. Dungeons and Settlements generated in that hex inherit that Trait instead of rolling a random Trait.

### Hex Features
When checking if a hex has a feature, roll 1d10 - if the result is lower than the hex's Hostility rating, roll on the feature table. Add +1 for each adjacent Overlord Domain or Haven:

| 1d8 + Hostility | POI Category                                                          | Notes                                                                                              |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2-4             | Villages & Towns                                                      | Settled areas with signs of local life, often in disrepair                                         |
| 5 – 8           | Dungeon                                                               | Catch‐all for ruins & relics, lurid lairs, or temples & shrines                                    |
| 9-10            | Rivers & Roads                                                        | If the tile already has river or road, re-roll on the feature table                                |
| 11+             | Overlord's Domain: Dungeon or Settlement under an Overlord's control. | Increase that Overlord's Domain level by 1, and roll on the Domain table to see what is discovered |

##### Rivers & Roads
- When generating a river or road, roll 1d4 to determine how many tiles it connects. Rivers always reroll a 1.
- Using the result of the d4 roll, roll Xd6 to determine which directions the river / road connects to - starting with North at 1, numbered clockwise.
- Do not reroll duplicates, they are ignored.
- When generating a hex connected to an existing river or road, roll for river & road generation automatically. This does not count against that hex's POI roll.
- If following a river or road from a previous Hex, and none of the dice match the direction you're moving from, replace the nearest result with your entry point.
- If a road or river connects to a Water Hex, it ends. 

##### Overlord Domains
- When generating an Overlord's domain roll 1d4 on the Overlord table to determine which Overlord the territory belongs to. If the Overlord already has an assigned Trait, apply it to the Domain - Otherwise, roll on the Traits table to assign a trait to the Overlord and their Domain.
	- If an Overlord's Domain already exists within 6 Hexes of a newly generated Domain hex, the new Domain belongs to that Overlord. 

After determining the Overlord & Trait, roll 2d6 on the Domain Table to determine what kind of Domain is found:

| **2d6 Roll** | **Result**    |
|-------------|--------------|
| 2-5         | **Settlement** |
| 6-12        | **Dungeon**   |
If the Domain is in a Hostility IV or V hex and the 2d6 result is less than the Overlord's current Domain level, you discover their Haven.
