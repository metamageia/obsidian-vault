# Notes

Playtest Notes
- Room Sparks and Shadows should apply to feature roles, make rooms/traits high on room tables favorable in flavor and lower ones less favorable in flavor to account for this. Same for features
	- Find a way to resolve which table to roll room sparks on when spending on feature tables? Or maybe just use Feature Sparks

Session 4 Notes
- Find a way to incorporate dungeon size rolls into determining exteriors
	- Give each dungeon a die size: d2, d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20
		- Switch to d6 pool
	- Roll four of the dungeon dice when moving through an unexplored door. If the total of the 4dX is *less than* the total number of generated rooms, it is an exit. If not, proceed to room generation.
- Find a way to determine locked doors before generation

Session 5 Notes
- On advance action, roll for encounter at the end of the advance? Also POI
	- Roll Encounter and Feature check simultaneously at the end of an Advance. Normal thresholds apply, except on a double you always find both.
- -2 haven adjacency


---

### Usurper Campaign Notes
Session 1
- 2d8 Door Check = Small Dungeon
	- Consider a d10 system, or increasing die sizes
- Proper Trap Generation Procedure needed
- Need a reminder to check for locked doors - integrate exterior check into it



---


Companion Notes
- Skills, Endurance, and Recovery Dice?
	- Companions Endurance and Recovery Dice = 10+Resist
	- Skill Die = Template DMG Die
	- Find a way to add skills to companions
-  Spend Population to generate companions
	- Recruit Companion: SPIRIT | SPEECH
	- From list of arrivals
- Companions Level = Haven Level

# Ideas

- Make Overlord Pack for Enemies
	- Look into Monster Themes from 4e
	- Create More Robust Generation Tools / Tables
- Expanded venture list / generator for campaign generation (like vows)
- Use Progress Clocks with Ventures for creating quests / "Vows"
	- Create a Commoner death clock for adjusting loot/encounter dice rolls?


### Travel
- Traits
	- When rolling doubles on hex generation, assign a Trait to that hex. 
		- Newly generated tiles of the same terrain type adjacent to the hex inherit its Trait.
		- Dungeons and Settlements generated in that hex inherit that Trait instead of rolling a random Trait.
