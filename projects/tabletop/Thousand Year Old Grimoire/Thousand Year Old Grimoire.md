Thousand Year Old Grimoire is a contemplative solo journaling role-playing game directly inspired by Thousand Year Old Vampire by Tim Hutchings. Take on the role of a sentient spellbook passed between hands throughout the ages collecting arcane lore and impacting the lives of those who find you.

Build your Grimoire page by page, leaflet by leaflet, as you play through a series of semi-random prompts accumulating spells, arcane theories, and the stories of those who wrote them.
