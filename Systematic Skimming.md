The key component of [[Inspectional Reading]], Systematic Skimming is about quickly surveying a text in order to get a feel for its contents and structure.

The steps to systematic skimming are as follows:
1. Examine the title page and Preface(s)
2. Study the Table of Contents
3. Explore the Index
4. Read the Publisher's blurb
5. Examine the chapters pivotal to the argument.
6. Skim the book, dipping in for a paragraph or two, but now more. 

Upon deciding whether or not the book is worth engaging with at a deeper level, you can proceed to the stage of [[Superficial Reading]] in preparation for [[Analytical Reading]].
