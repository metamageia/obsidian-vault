*This idea is still very much under construction and needs development*

An idea for a [[MOSAIC Strict]] [[Use-Based Skill Systems]] inspired by [[Habit Score Cards]]. 

Skill Score Cards are a simple method for tracking, using, and improving skills and abilities over time in the absence of a conventional progression system. This system has a mode for one-shot play and a mode for session based play, allowing the GM to choose the pacing depending on the type of game being played. It also has an expansive mode and a retractive mode, depending on if you want the characters to become more or less powerful over time (the latter being great for narrative-focused Horror games).

### Setup
On a single index card, create a list of one or two word skills specific to your character as deemed appropriate by the Gamemaster, and next to each skill draw a row of five empty squares.

### Rules
Campaign Play: Each time a player lands a "Critial Hit"
One-Shot: Each time a player makes a successful role with a skill
-
Expansive Play: Add your skill to the roll (Or maybe a roll under 1d6?)
Contractive Play: Subtract your skill from the roll (or maybe a roll over 1d6)
