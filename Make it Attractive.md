Identifying and exploiting the need generated by a cue can help to circumvent the need for willpower by making the behavior desirable.
- Temptation bundling, like stacking, pairs a new habit with something you already do/enjoy, allowing likely actions to reinforce less likely ones.
- Reframing hard habits into good ones by saying "I get to" rather than "I have to" helps to reduce friction.
