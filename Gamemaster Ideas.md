This note is a temporary staging area for GM ideas and tips that are currently too short to be split off into their own notes.

## General Tips
- Always accept the coolest idea at the table. 
	- Frequently ask players how they'd like to attempt something rather than a flat "yes" or "no".
	- Always record player ideas & requests for gifts & consequences.
- The [BehindTheTables subreddit wiki ](https://www.reddit.com/r/BehindTheTables/wiki/index/)includes countless roll tables for nearly every situation. 
	- Randroll [has a collection of PDFs](https://www.randroll.com/solo-rpg-pdfs/) specifically tailored to Solo play. 
- Advantages of minimalism
	- The game remains in the imagination, creating more space for immersion rather than less. Keeps it inside the mind of the players
	- Promotes vivid description, keeps the group from leaning on the visual representation of characters and terrain 
	- The effect on prep. Minimalism saves massive amounts of time. Allowing for abstraction removes the need for tactical detail. More conceptual prep
- Explore options for [[Collaborative Worldbuilding]], especially [[Worldbuilding Games]] 
	- [[The best TTRPG trends for 2025 aren't in any rulebook]]

## Running Campaigns
- Consider "Knife Theory" in session zero. Player characters who add more "knives" to their backstory, plot hooks that can be used by the GM to "stab" the player, the easier they are to integrate into the story.
- When worldrunning, make use of "world timers". Make sure the players understand the presence and impact of passing time.

---
## Running One-shots
- Write your one-shot sessions around a 3-act structure, spanning roughly 1hr-2hr-1hr for ideal pacing.
- Time turns to avoid too much idle time.
- Create backup characters or assign NPCs to players who die during a one-shot so they're not sitting out the rest of the game. 

---
## Adventure Design
- Don't wait to use your best ideas. Most campaigns have a short run time and often go unfinished, create cool experiences early and often.
- Focus on node-based adventure design. Prepare situations, not plots. 
	- Situations / nodes *can* be mapped to a "plot tree", wherein scene archetypes can be loosely connected together on the fly to imply an overarching plot, even when such a plot doesn't actually exist
- Create interesting dilemmas and push the players to make meaningful decisions.

## Running Combat
- When running boss battles in combat-focused games, take inspiration from MMORPGs and include well broadcasted "Legendary Attacks" for players to avoid and exploit. 

---
## Rewards
- Loot should be worth more than it useful, that way players won't be disappointed if they happen to loot something they can't use or don't want to use.

---
## Running Downtime
- **[[Campfire Tales]]**
	- Great prompt during rests to get the characters to share a bit about their past, where they've come from, how they feel about where they're at, and where they want to go
	- Look up "Stars and Wishes"
	- Use information from campfire tales to improve a *players* experiments

---
## Using Random Generation
- Roll twice on random tables and combine or interpolate the result for much more variety. 
- Combining multiple prompts from multiple tables can create more unique encounters.
- [[Reskinning]] mechanics and stat blocks massively increases the value you get out of existing content 
### Oracle Dice
- A d20 oracle can be used to generate a random challenge target
- D20 can be used for weather, time of day, and anything else random without needing a chart.
- Can be use as a gauge for anything that can be abstracted into a spectrum, like morale or temperament.

## TTRPG Note Taking
- Names of NPCs and information, especially if you roll randomly, is very important
	- Context specifically, such as traits or voices is also nice to know
- Notes are specifically for things you wont remember
- The specific ending scene is critical to keep in mind
- Specific character moments are very important to remember too
	- Items, backstory, character connections
- Some things don't need notes to be taken
	- You can check off secrets revealed, but aren't important to track as a history
