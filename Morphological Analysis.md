A method for brainstorming creative solutions to complicated problems, first devised by astronomer Fritz Zwicky. A simplified version of Morphological Analysis.

The core of the technique is to divide the problem into multiple categories and fill those columns with possible values. From there you can explore the variables in different combinations to generate novel solutions. Incredibly powerful technique for Brainstorming and Problem Solving
