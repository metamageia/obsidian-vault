[[Nothing at the Bottom - MOSAIC Strict and Modular TTRPG Design]]
## Introduction

Based on the [2021 blog post by Michael Prescott](https://blog.trilemma.com/2021/02/nothing-at-bottom-mosaic-strict-rpg.html), MOASIC Strict is a conceptual framework for designing TTRPG rules that are:
- Modular
- Optional
- Short
- Attested
- Independent
- Coreless

## Noteworthy Discussions

- This [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/RPGdesign/comments/153hvox/thought_experiment_on_mosaic_design/) has some interesting discussions, especially /u/fuseboy's (Michael Prescott) example of gold based magic and advancement modules. 
	- /u/ryschwith brought up Cortex Prime as an interesting example of modular RPG design, worth taking another look at.
- Gwyllgi over on Itch also presented the idea of [CERAMIC Strict](https://gwyllgi.itch.io/ceramic-strict), a variant on MOSAIC focused on removing randomness and promoting accessibility. Could be a useful keyword to check when looking for new ideas. 
	- Here is a collection of CERAMIC modules: https://itch.io/c/2645424/ceramic-strict
- Alone in the Labyrinth wrote up their [[Ludic Fragments the MOSAIC Strict Manifesto]]
	- It's mostly a recap of the original post, followed my an overview of their own MELEE module. 
- Sabrecat [shared some of their experience](https://world.hey.com/sabrecat/actual-play-using-strictly-mosaics-001bb789) running a session with only MOSAIC modules ([[Actual Play using Strictly MOSAICs!]])
	- Some notes from their experience: Running MOSAIC Sessions via VTT is difficult because of the software's assumptions. 
	- Player-Facing modules like Twenty Backgrounds make for a lot of novel fun. 
	- MOSAIC modules really "hum" when you can find modules with emergent interactions, like Experience and A Flexible Resolution System. 
- This article on ["FRESCO Flexible" by Steve D](https://dconstructions.wordpress.com/2023/09/07/from-mosaic-strict-to-fresco-flexible/), albeit a bit excessively contrarian, shares some of my thoughts regarding opening up / expanding the core ideas of MOSAIC Strict.

## Mildly Relevant Information
- Michael Prescott's post [[Whose Mechanic is it Anyway]] establishes a couple principles for designing mechanics.
	- (1) The player who needs to use a quantity should be the one tracking it.
	- (2) The player who desires the outcome of a mechanic should be responsible for invoking it.
	- (2.b) Mechanics which produce only negative or positive outcomes are especially important to give to the proper player
		- Prescott uses the classic encumbrance example 
	- Pairing both good and bad outcomes in the same mechanic incentivizes players to keep track of even detrimental mechanics.

## Interesting Modules 

#### Collections
- There's the two posts (and accompanying spreadsheet) from Michael's own blog:
	- First: https://blog.trilemma.com/2021/04/some-mosaic-strict-sets-appear.html
	- Second: https://blog.trilemma.com/2021/07/more-mosaic-strict-sets.html
	- The Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PQLmSyj94TBh5kUguinxorYAxwdYMH0o6BMttvJU5VM/edit#gid=0

#### Individual Modules
- [A Patterned Magic](https://blog.trilemma.com/2023/11/a-patterned-magic.html) by Michael Prescott. Not technically mosaic, but an interesting example of mini-games as mechanics.
	- Notes: It kind of assumes it'll be an interface for an existing spell system (so not mosaic), but is incredibly flexible because of that. Seems heavily inspired by Sudoku, should consider doing something similar with other solo games and systems like Solitaire, Mahjong, etc 
- Michael also has an interesting [Downtime Calendar](https://blog.trilemma.com/2023/09/a-downtime-calendar.html) which can be modified / adapted to get players more invested in the passage of time in a long-term campaign.

## Ideas
- PBTA style Playbooks with explicitly defined moves and mechanics could make for very compelling player-facing modules
- Grimwild Story Kits & Encounter Statblocks 
- Emblema as a metaphor for central piece around which a mosaic is build
- Modello or maquette for templates and kits
