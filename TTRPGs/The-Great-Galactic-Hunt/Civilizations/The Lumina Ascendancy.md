Culture: This society reveres a blend of non-Abrahamic faiths and philosophical traditions, where spiritual leaders often double as cultural artisans and scholars. They are dedicated to the peaceful spread of knowledge and art, with their academies serving as centers for inter-religious dialogue and cultural exchange across sectors. The three most prominent faiths are:

- The Way of Harmonious Flow: A philosophy emphasizing balance and natural cycles, often expressed through intricate dance and musical compositions.
- The Architects of Inner Worlds: A spiritual path focused on meditation and the creation of personal, mental sanctuaries, often manifested in abstract art and dream-weaving narratives.
- The Echoes of the Elder Stars: A reverence for the knowledge and wisdom gleaned from ancient, distant stellar phenomena, inspiring their astronomical studies and complex storytelling.
