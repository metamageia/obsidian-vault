# The Republic of Craig

Technology Advantage: Advanced Psionics and Hive Mind Control

Home Planet: Xylos, Urbanized Surface

Sub-Species: Craigs

Culture: The Republic of Craig is a unique and unsettling hive mind, born from a catastrophic scientific breakthrough. A mad scientist named Craig, delving into the Broadcast's most heavily encrypted data, successfully decoded schematics for advanced mind-reading and control technologies. During his experiments, a catastrophic accident occurred, permanently implanting his own consciousness across every individual on the planet. Now, every "Craig" on the homeworld shares a single, unified mind, acting as a collective entity with unparalleled internal communication and coordination.

However, the further a Craig travels from their homeworld, the weaker the central psychic link becomes. Individuals or groups of Craigs detached from the planet for extended periods may slowly regain a semblance of individuality, or form smaller, localized hive minds among themselves. This gradual breaking away from the central consciousness is a source of both existential dread and quiet fascination for those few Craigs who experience it.
