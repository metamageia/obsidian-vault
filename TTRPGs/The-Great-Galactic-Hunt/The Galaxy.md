# The Galaxy:
The Modern Galactic Stage is in its infancy, with the Broadcast only occurring 150 years ago. But the Galaxy itself is much older than that, a deep look will reveal millenia old structures and ruins of the past. One active one is the Jump Gates, while FTL travel can allow travel between nearby systems to happen in a week or so, Jump Gates allow for near instantaneous travel to their connected nodes. Itâ€™s hypothesized that the broadcast originated from these gates, yet their actual operational method remains a mystery.
