The process of systematically resurfacing and gradually contributing work to writing projects over an extended period of time. I was first exposed to the idea by the work of [[Andy  Matuschak]] when researching unconventional applications of [[Spaced Repetition]]. This method of incremental writing takes advantage of the potential [[Programmable Attention]] effect of spaced repetition tools to facilitate [[Habit Stacking]], allowing the typically low-friction task of habits like flipping through flashcards to automatically drop you into what might be otherwise be a high-friction task, like writing.
