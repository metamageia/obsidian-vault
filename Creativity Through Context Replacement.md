[[Raph Koster]] describes creativity as primarily emerging from the novel collision of ideas as the result of changing any given idea's context. He describes individual ideas as being like "bricks", and moving a familiar "brick" out of a familiar setting into a meaningfully unfamiliar context allows for connections and collisions that would otherwise never occur.
