- Well designed encounters have three definitive qualities:
	- Drive - the reason behind the encounter, particularly the player's motivations.
	- Impact - the consequences of the encounter, both in success and failure.
		- Do not create soft threats. Always emphasize impact.
	- Flavor - every encounter should strive to be thematic and memorable.
		- No "empty room" encounters. Make spaces just as engaging and enemies.
