		- On [Learning in Public](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Learning+in+public)
		- She is also [writing a book in public](https://doingitinpublic.com/) with a GitHub repo where [people can contribute](https://github.com/nicolevanderhoeven/doing-it-in-public/)
	- [Obsidian Hub](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/00+-+Start+here) is an experimental vault maintained by the community, which people can actively [contribute to on GitHub](https://github.com/obsidian-community/obsidian-hub) While all of the documents are very much focused on Obsidian itself, I can imagine this format being an interesting and engaging way to work on collaborative world building projects 
	- Tristram Oaten of the YouTube channel [NoBoilerplate](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMwY9iS8oMyWDYIe6_RmoA)  hosts an obsidian vault on GitHub which he treats as the open source "code" of all of his videos, an interesting example
