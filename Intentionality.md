A term originating with philosopher and psychologist [[Franz Brentano]] and popularized by [[Edmund Husserl]], Intentionality is an essential component of Husserl's [[Phenomenology]]. Used to mean something like "directedness" and "aboutness", the intentional capacity is a description of the fact that consciousness is always conscious "of" something, a subject oriented towards a phenomenal object. This is more clearly articulated in the concept of [[Noesis and Noema]].
