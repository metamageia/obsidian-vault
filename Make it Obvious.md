The most effective cues are ones anchored in time and/or space.
- [[Habit Score Cards]] track progress and gamify consistency. 
- Stacking uses a current habit as the cue for a new one.
- Environment design arranges space so that the desired behavior is both the most obvious and the most accessible. One should strive to dedicate each space to a single behavior.
