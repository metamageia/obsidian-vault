The structure of a habit is made up of four steps across two stages:
- Problem Stage
	1. Cue: The specific stimuli set to trigger the behavior.
	2. Craving: The need or desire emerging in response to the cue.
- Solution Stage
	3. Response: The behavior performed to satisfy craving.
	4. Reward: The immediate positive or negative feedback resulting from the response to the craving.
