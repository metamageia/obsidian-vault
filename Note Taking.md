### Kinds of Notes
Notes can generally be divided into three broad categories:
- [[Structural Notes]]: Outlines made during [[Inspectional Reading]].
- [[Conceptual Notes]]: Observations made in the process of [[Analytical Reading]].
- [[Dialectical Notes]]: Comments on the shape of discussion engages in by all relevant authors during [[Syntopical Reading]]. 

Adler's categories of note types listed above applies cleanly to the [[Antinet Zettlekasten]] workflow. The [[Bibcards]] used in Luhmmann's system can be described as Structural, the individual zettles themselves as Analytical, and the Antinet as a whole (including one's own notes and comments scattered throughout) are Dialectical in nature.
