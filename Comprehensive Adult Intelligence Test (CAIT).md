The aim of project CAIT is to provide a free resource for estimating a [[Full Scale IQ (FSIQ)]] score for adults interested in  [[Cognitive Assessment]]. The CAIT is designed for individuals over the age of 16.

The CAIT is inspired by and formatted to resemble the [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)]]. Overall, the goal is to provide a similar but streamlined experience that can estimate FSIQ in a timely manner.

Estimating FSIQ across a diverse range of test batteries is the best way to estimate the [[G-Factor]], or general factor of intelligence. Most online IQ tests concentrate on measuring a single factor. The CAIT is designed to provide a more comprehensive view of general intelligence by testing multiple factors.
