I'm using the term Process broadly in the [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]]-ian sense of a procession of occasions of experience. It's here I acknowledge [[Process Philosophy|Process Ontology]] as a necessary logical prior to my working definition of "Agent" that you may-or-may-not share. 

It suspect requires the capacity to experience and select, but not necessarily cognition. A sunflower and experience the direction of the sun, and selectively orient itself towards it - in that sense I'd describe the sunflower as definitively demonstrating *agency* while its capacity for *cognition* remains metaphysically ambiguous. 

This category can (obviously) include biological agents such as animals and plants; however, this umbrella also covers what can be described as [[Sociocybernetics|Sociocybernetic]] agents (such as states, corporations, religious organizations), as well as metaphysical agents such as spirits, deities, and [[Archetypes]] (which affect change in the world regardless of assumed ontological validity).
