A term borrowed from aviation, preflighting is the [[Prepress]] process of reviewing digital artwork & layout files in preparation for print. This includes, but is not limited to:
- Verifying the [[Trim]] and [[Resolution]] of the file
- Checking [[Bleed]] for elements that should extend beyond the trim
- Checking [[Safety]] / [[Gutter]] to prevent components from getting cut off in print
- [[Trapping]] overlapping assets to eliminate gaps from [[Misregistration]]
- Verify the correct [[Color Space]] and [[Color Separations]] of assets for the intended medium
