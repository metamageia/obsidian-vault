The modularity of [[MOSAIC Strict]] presents a unique opportunity for [[Contractive and Expansive Worlds|Expansive World Design]] in [[Table Top Role Playing Games (TTRPGs)|TTRPGs]]. By [[Atomizing and Abstracting Game Mechanics]] down into distinct modules or "mini-games", you can effectively compartmentalize the systems players use to interact with & through the fictions, allowing you to appropriately introduce new [[Adding Gameplay Verbs and Goals|verbs and goals]] into the game as the world unfolds around them. 

This approach to expansive, modular, and responsive game design you can circumvent the pressure to mechanically model every possible action and affordance the players will need to have access to before beginning play. Instead, new systems can be intentionally introduced and phased out to approiately match to the specific field of agentic expression you are drying to model as a Gamemaster and designer.
