Fundamental to [[Hellenistic Astrology]], Sect alters the function of [[Benefics and Malefics]] in an [[Astrological Chart]]. The [[Diurnal Sect]] planets are [[Sun]], [[Jupiter]], and [[Saturn]]. The [[Nocturnal Sect]] planets are [[Moon]], [[Venus]], and [[Mars]]. [[Mercury]] aligns with the sect of the ruler of its [[Bounds]], or more commonly by whether its a morning or evening stars. 

[[Planets]] that are considered in-sect in a given chart generally more constructive, while those out of sect are thought to be agitated or inhibited in some way. 

#### Rejoicing Conditions
Less important than sect, diurnal planets prefer to be above the horizon in a day chart and below it in a night chart - with the reverse being true of nocturnal planets. There are also rejoicing schemes based on the [[Zodiac]], but most of them conflict.
