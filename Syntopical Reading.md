The art of reading many books, placing them in relation to each other, and the topics which they concern. This is generally done through the process of conducting an [[Analytical Reading]] of individual texts while taking [[Conceptual Notes]] on the topic of interest, followed up with [[Extrinsic Reading]] and conducting a comparison of the sources by making [[Dialectical Notes]] of some kind. 

#### Steps to Syntopical Reading
Part 1: Pre-reading
1. Build a tentative bibliography of potentially relevant books.
2. Inspect all chosen books for relevancy to the topic of interest and prune unnecessary sources to get a clear idea of the scope of the project. 
Part 2: Syntopical Reading
3. Inspect all books for relevant chapters and sections through [[Systematic Skimming]].
4. Bring all of the authors to terms by [[Coming to Terms]] with each one and establishing a unified terminology. 
5. Establish a list of questions to which all authors give answers to. (See [[Identify an Author's Solutions]])
6. Identify key points of conflict.
7. Order the questions and issues from most general to most specific, the begin analysis and comparison.
