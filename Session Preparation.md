### The Lazy Dungeon Master Approach
Utilize the [[Eight Steps of the Lazy Dungeon Master]]. When [[Running One-shots]] or working with minimal preparation time focus on steps two, four, and eight for maximum impact for the least effort.
	1. Review the Characters
	2. <u>Create a Strong Start</u>
	3. Outline Potential Scenes
	4. <u>Define Secrets and Clues</u>
	5. Develop Fantastic Locations
	6. Outline Important NPC
	7. Choose Relevant Enemies
	8. <u>Select Major Rewards</u>

### Modular Adventure Preparation
Instead of preparing a railroaded sequence of scenes, instead break those scenes down into modular components. Preparing Fantastic Locations, Enemies & NPCs, Secrets & Clues, Major Rewards, and *potential* scenes allows for the ideal blend of preparation and improvisation.
