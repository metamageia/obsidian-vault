Roll for Role a flexible, freeform [[MOSAIC Strict]] module for [[Table Top Role Playing Games (TTRPGs)|TTRPG]] [[Class Systems]]. Either when creating a character or beginning a session players will roll on a "role chart", which will assign them an abstract character class. Whenever a character performs an action that is appropriate to their Role, if that action requires any sort of conflict resolution or has a potential for bonuses, the appropriate bonus will be granted.

Example Role Chart:

| 1d6 | Role       |
| --- | ---------- |
| 1   | Juggernaut |
| 2   | Herald     |
| 3   | Recon      |
| 4   | Defender   |
| 5   | Sabatour   |
| 6   | Medic      |

Keeping character classes abstract but still defining a clear character role encourages teamwork and coordination, and if the Gamemaster chooses to permit re-rolls at specific times, it also encourages experimentation.
