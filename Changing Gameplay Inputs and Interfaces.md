Altering the way a player interfaces with a game can often make it feel like an [[Koster's Taxonomy of Games|entirely new Variant]], even if the underlying rules construct is identical. With a drastic enough change, input alone could be enough to turn it into an entirely different variant. This works because [[Atomizing and Abstracting Game Mechanics|games are made of several smaller games]], and the inputs themselves are a kind of mini-game that can be swapped out to create novel experiences. 
A few ideas to consider:
- Changing the number of axis of control
- Altering time & duration
- Fracturing a simple control into a complex arrangement of controls
- Merging a complex control arrangement into a single, simple control
- Swapping or Mixing inputs
