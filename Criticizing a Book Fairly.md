Reading is a conversation that doesn't end with understanding, but must necessarily be completed with criticism. One mustn't read to take a book for granted or reject it mindlessly, but weigh and consider everything that's been read. 

To be serious in receiving communication, one must be moth responsive and responsible. You must understand clearly what is being said, but also have a responsibility to take a stance on the matter.
