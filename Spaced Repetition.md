A method for improved learning through reviewing information at spaced intervals, typically at increasing increments. Methods using Spaced Repetition principles have been shown to be highly effective in improving both conceptual comprehension and rote memorization. Utilizing systems and tools to resurface important or meaningful information makes memory a choice, as a reliable Spaced Repetition system preserves it and helps to gradually encode the information into long-term memory over time. 

Spaced Repetition can be abstracted down to a three primary components:
1. A priority queue of micro-tasks
2. An interactive environment which presents sufficiently high-priority tasks
3. Feedback actions which modify a task's subsequent priority

I personally use the [[Spaced Repetition Plugin]] in [[Obsidian]] for reviewing information. Spaced Repetition systems also have some fascinating unconventional uses cases concerning ideas such as [[Programmable Attention]], [[Laws of Habit Modification|habit modification]], and [[Incremental Writing]].
