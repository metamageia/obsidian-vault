The [Beta Reviewer's Auto-Update Tool](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) is an Obsidian community plugin for installing and updating [[Obsidian Plugins]]. 

It effectively allows users to conveniently use plugins from Github repositories that aren't currently available in the community plugins tab.
